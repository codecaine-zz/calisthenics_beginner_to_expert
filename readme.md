# Calisthenics Beginner to Expert Workout Program

The Excel workout files provided in this program are designed to help you track your progress and plan your workouts effectively. Each file contains:

- **Workout Plan**: A detailed plan outlining the exercises, sets, reps, and rest periods for each workout session.
- **Progress Tracker**: A section to log your weights, reps, and any notes for each exercise, allowing you to monitor your progress over time.

**RM (Repetition Maximum)**: The maximum weight you can lift for a given number of repetitions. For example, 1RM is the heaviest weight you can lift for one rep, while 5RM is the max weight you can lift for five reps.

**TM (Training Max)**: A percentage of your 1RM used for programming and progression. Itâ€™s usually set around 85-90% of your true 1RM to allow for consistent progress without overtraining.
